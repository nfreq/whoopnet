# Whoopnet

Whoopnet is a harness for AI-driven feedback controls designed for Tiny Whoop class (sub-25-gram) multirotor vehicles.  

While compatible with any unmodified FPV multirotor that supports ELRS and Betaflight, the project focuses on targeting sub-25-gram vehicles and advancing offboard compute capabilities to enable AI-driven models and autonomous software.  

This flexibility allows your 20-gram robot to leverage a 100-pound brain, depending on your edge compute requirements, enabling scalable computational power for advanced tasks and experimentation.

## Major Components of Whoopnet

### ROS Integration
- **Video Feedback:** Captures and streams real-time visual data for processing by AI models.  
- **IMU Feedback:** Provides orientation and motion data, fused with vision to enable accurate state estimation for visual-inertial odometry, navigation and autonomous decision-making.  
- **Handset Input:** Enables manual control inputs from a pilot, serving as a fallback or supplement to AI operations.  
- **RC Output:** Transmits AI-processed or pilot commands to the multirotorâ€™s control system for execution.  
- **Real-Time Control and Data Collection:** Facilitates real-time interactions and logs data critical for training AI models, enabling iterative improvements to system performance.

### IMU-Camera Calibration Process Documentation
- A detailed guide for aligning inertial measurement units (IMUs) with cameras on FPV-based multirotors, ensuring accurate sensor fusion for precise navigation and control.  
- Includes step-by-step instructions for calibration, troubleshooting tips, and recommendations for maintaining alignment during operations.

### ELRS Repeater/RC Path Mixer
- **Human Manual Control:** Allows pilots to fully control the multirotor in scenarios requiring human oversight.  
- **Handoff:** Facilitates seamless transitions between human control and autonomous AI-driven operations.  
- **Mixed Autonomous Operation:** Combines human input with AI adjustments for enhanced control and safety, ideal for complex flight scenarios.

### Betaflight Modifications and ExpressLRS 
- **Betaflight Modifications:** Custom changes to the flight control software to enable high-speed raw IMU telemetry, including the creation of a new IMU extended CRSF packet and dedicating the entire telemetry channel for this purpose.  
- **ExpressLRS:** Utilizes ExpressLRS's existing F1000Hz mode to provide the necessary telemetry bandwidth for real-time data transmission.

## Hardware Requirements for Whoopnet

### FPV Multirotors
- Includes vehicles as small as Tiny Whoop class (sub-25-gram) multirotors.  
- Examples:  
  - **Mobula6 HDZero ECO 2024**  
  - **Mobula6 Freestyle HD**  
- (Any multirotor with ELRS and a video system that supports VRX->HDMI)

### ELRS Transmitter(s)
- Used for remote communication and control with "high-speed" telemetry.  
- Example: **BETAFPV 2.4GHZ 1W Micro RF Module (Supports CRSF over USB)**

### VRX with HDMI Output
- A video receiver capable of streaming real-time FPV video feed through an HDMI interface.  
- Example: **HDZero VRX (HDZero Monitor) /w HDMI Output**

### Video Capture Device
- Captures the video feed from the VRX and integrates it into the system for processing and display.  
- **Recommendation:** 60Hz @ 1080p for calibration; 30Hz should be fine for real-time control.

### ELRS RX to USB Gamepad
- Converts ELRS signals to a USB gamepad for utilization with the RC handset input and mixing capabilities.  
- Examples: **SquidStick, RC Handset USB**, etc.
